1. What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
- Understanding the Problem, Plan to solve the Problem and divide the problem in smaller problems
2. Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
- If you just start over try to code a solution, you tend to try a solution if it doesn't work you try another. This is very time consuming and not effective.
3. What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
- There are multiple ways to achieve a clear understanding. One way is to write the solution down in plain english. Another way is to explain the problem to a friend.
4. What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
- After you understood the problem you can write a solution in pseudo code. Another way is to draw a sketch.
5. What is an algorithm?
- An algorithm is sequence of operations to create a special output of an input.
6. What is pseudocode?
- Pseucode is language which is used to write down a logic for a problem.
8. What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
- By dividing a problem in smaller problems you get an overview and also create a structure which you can follow to solve the problem. A lot of smaller are also less intimidating and are easier to solve. By solving all the small problem, you solve the big problem by combining them.
