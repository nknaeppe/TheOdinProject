1. Why is it important to write clean code?
- If a your code is not clear, you will have a problem in understanding after you come back to it after some time has passed. You will waste a lot of time in trying to understand it. A clean self explanatory piece of code time helps you understand what it is doing as you read it. Also you are often working in a team and other people have to work with your code. If it is too complex they need a lot of time to understand it, which wastes a lot of time and can be very frustating.
2. Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
- Taking time to write down the logic before coding it
- By Commenting why u code something. Dont write comments, that explains how the code works, that whats the code is for
- Using names in functions and variables that are  meaningfull
- structure the code, by using identations
- divide big function into smaller functions
3. What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
- good comments: eplains why the code is written, is only used when the code can be written more understandable, less comments are used
- bad comments: overused, dont focus on why the code is written and explains the code, are used with complex code
